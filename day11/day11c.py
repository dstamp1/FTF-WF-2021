Afternoon Session

### For the afternoon, you and your partner will continue to incorporate an API into a flask project.

## You can continue to work on your Jeopardy flask app and include additional functionality.
#### Adding a form to receive a response
#### Adding a form to allow for selecting categories
#### Using the session variable to keep track of the player's score
#### Using additional bootstrap components (maybe a Modal) to improve user experience

# OR #
## You can look up another API to explore and write a new flask route to include it. You might only be able to write 1-2 routes and you'll focus on reading through the API documentation. Some APIs to consider:
https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api
https://developers.google.com/books
http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/     
#And a longer lists here:

# Since you only have 1 hour, if you're new to APIs I recommend sticking with an API that does not require signing up for a key. If you're feeling comfortable with working with APIs, let your imagination run wild!
