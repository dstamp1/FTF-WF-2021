# Slide deck should include: 
# Demo: Show the app and how to use it 
# The story of their project (What are you trying to solve and who are you trying to help? What motivated this idea?)
# What are you most proud of? (feel free to screenshots part of your code or highlight particular app) 
# What would you do if you have more time? Whatâ€™s next for you?
