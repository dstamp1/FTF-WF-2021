# Morning Session -- Review- other game + kahoot
# Git Hub commits
# Calculator Projects
# Mentor meeting @ 12

# Let's start today with a stretch and share
## Opening question _____
## Students can change the stretch or keep it going
## And then post a kokology

### Launch into Review Kahoot (try to start this early)

## Students will go into breakout rooms for ~15 minutes to work on soomething
# Can doo check in with Anjali and Jaspreet

# Bio Break starting at 10:05-10:15

## Let's try out https://www.spyfall.app/gamerules
# Share the rules before going to break
# Split into 2 breakout rooms
### Don't share screens

#### Github Commiting ####
#note: it's really important we utilizes these 15 minutes strongly to do some of the set up of using Githuv. it will pay dividends

# GitHub is a place to share code! Even NASA uses it.

# Github is designed to support collaboration and version control.

## To try it out, we will go to github.com and log in (or create a new account)
## Then we will visit this URL https://github.com/upperlinecode/python-project-template

## And we'll click the button to *use this template* and give it a name for our repos

## and finally, we can clone down your personal copy by clickign the green code button and copying the link.
## WE'll do git clone https://github.com/dstamp1/python-project-v1.git inside of your day04 folder

### green check when you have cloned your copy of the templalte from your github account

# Today we will go through the process of making a change and pushing it to our github repo

# cloudhshelll open calc.py and define a function called add(x,y) that returns the sum of x and y. Green check when you're done

# To record this change
## just like we use pwd and ls in the terminal to check in, we do the same with git by runnning git status

# Then we will add the file we just changed
git add calc.py

#Then we need to commit the changes in this file and attach a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"
#Git messages are for you and your collaborates. They often start with verbs and explain the change(S) that you made

# and finally we push this change back to github

git push

## let's talk about the error messsage that we got
# before we can push this commit to github, cloudshell needs to know our github username and email so it can innclude that information
# okay, so we update the global variables that stoore that info
# we push again and need to enter our github password

# and we can check this worked by doing another git status

## Even though we will be collaborating today, we won't be using github during that process but we will be using it on our main project
