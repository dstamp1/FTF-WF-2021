## Today we will spend the morning applying our skills to build a book review site.

## I will provide some starter code and the mongo databases

## You and you partner will be able to practice
# Writing Flask Routes
# Styling with Bootstrap

## The site will consist of user pages, book pages, and review pages.

## Let's look at the GitHub page https://github.com/dstamp1/mongodb-extension

##### Scroll through the pages

## You'll make a template of this file.

## And let's create a .env file and add the Mongo credentials
MONGO_DBNAME = 'books'
MONGO_DB_USERNAME = 'admin'
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD = '3ASycAm71TKafd12'
