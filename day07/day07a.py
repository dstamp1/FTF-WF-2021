Morning Session

## Morning Routine
# Stretch and share....if you could make a website about anything, what would it be about?
## Share with students that websites aren't just about making money, they can be about important causes

## Let's play debugger today!

## Microfeedback
### Great feedback about being able to choose their best path for the afternoon. Loved more open ended tasks. We will be doing that today, starting even sooner
### Learning how to code is about more than accumulating knowledge and content skills. When you become a software developer, it is an expectation that you are able to learn from and teach others; whether its the ins and outs of yourr company's flagship program or a new language you've never heard of before. Being able to use empathy and improving your navigating skills will make you a much better programming and team player in the long run. Use this time to practice and improve!

## Today we're going to dive into HTML + CSS. By the end of today, we want to be able to understand how to place tags in an HTML file and how to style via classes and IDs. 
## While this might not be new to you, we want a strong foundation so we can learn how to use Bootstrap and, eventually, use Python to dynamically generate HTML.

## We'll start off this morning identifying strengths and weaknesses of good web design. Then we'll bifurcate. 

### If you want to take on the challenge of designing a webpage and figure it out yourself with documentation, you have a three hour hackathon today to arrive at a webpage yoou're proud of.
### If you want to go at a more metered pace with more group work, checkpoints, and structured labs, you'll work with the larger group through lunch time and spend the hour after lunch designing 

### Take a few minutes to search the web for sites you find to be particular beautiful and ones that could use some design tweaks. We'll go into breakout rooms after 2 minutes so you can screenshare.


### Now that we have a sense of what feels like good and not so good web design, let's collaborate on a document that encapsulates what we believe to be true about web design. Go to this google document and add 1-2 things you picked up from our conversations: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z-4DmdBEltZO7kym3YJLXBog3cdvRGueASP_ga_sPs4/edit?usp=sharing

## The last thing for us to do together is to log into glitch https://glitch.com/signin (use your GitHub account) to do your web design for today. Cloudshell is overkill and we'll be able to push our pages to GitHub & set them up with GitHub pages.
# I have created a very basic template that you will click the "remix to edit" button: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dstamp-html-template

## Green check once you have your own copy of the basic HTML template.


#Hopefully we're at the 25 minute mark or so..lol

## PM Derek which path you'll be taking today
### Hackathon style and create a beautiful website to showcase at 2:15pm. Guidlines and stretch additions available in slack https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYC36O1jE_xqNeBhSizA8ut6dAzlJlT_ZVtBga659ns/edit?usp=sharing
### Team style and work together on labs to create a beautiful website to showcase at 2:15pm


### Into to HTML ###
#HTML is not a scripting language, it is a language that communicates structure and hierarchy within a document.
# We can go to any website (like https://www.wikipedia.org/) and do a right click + inspect to see this code that web browsers read to generate websites.
# HTML provides the structure and CSS provides the visual styling.

# The core construction in HTML is the tag.

## Tags consist of abbreviations or short words and have an opening and closing version.

#<tag> _content_ </tag>

# And a central premise of HTML tags is that they can be nested inside of one another. This relationship is known as a parent-child relationship.

<div>
  <p>Nested</p>
</div>


## First, let's practice nesting and placing image tags (you'll look up documentation on how to do this) in the Boroughs Nesting Lab. To copy it into glitch, we'll go to the glitch home page and copy the git link https://github.com/upperlinecode/NYC_Boroughs_Lab.git

## 15 minutes of play time here ##
##################################################
# Now that we have some content on the page, we can start to style what we see.

# CSS gives us many ways to specify which elements we're going to apply style to. Let's start with one of the most specific ways, using an id.

# The boroughs lab already includes some styling. Take a look at it and how that code showed up on the screen. CSS consists of rules. Each rule connects a CSS property with a value. The rule has a : in the middle and rules are separated by ;. There are so many different rules you can construct and you have to consider how multiple rules would interact. It is so much fun!

# Take 10 minutes to google different CSS properties and make the borough lab your own. If you're unsure where to get started, changing colors is always fun.


### Class Selectors ####
# So far we've had to style each id on it's own. Not too bad when there's 5. But imagine we had this site to style. Make a copy into glitch https://github.com/upperlinecode/css-classes-template.git

# We can see there's some overlap here between paragraphs and some paragraphs share some features.
# CSS gives us a way to style more than one element at a time with classes. We preface classes with a . in the CSS file. Let's write some css for these classes given to us.

# Another powerful feature of classes is that an element can have more than 1 class. This gives us a ton of flexability

### Bifurcation ###
# This was our crash course in HTML + CSS!
# You can start your mini-hackathon and begin constructing your website

## There's also a few more activities we have if you want to focus in on HTML + CSS
