<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-2">Logo content</div>
    <div class="col-lg-2">Company content</div>
    <div class="col-lg-2">Communities content</div>
    <div class="col-lg-2">Useful links content</div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">Social icons - this one is twice as wide as the other four.</div>
  </div>
</div>
